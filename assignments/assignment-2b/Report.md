# Report on Assignment 2B

**Team ID:** *add*

**Student Name(s):** *add*


## Feature set (max. 300 words)

  * Briefly list *all* the features implemented in your code, one feature per bullet point. If the implementation of a feature was not trivial, briefly describe the implementation. Use short, distinctive, and informative names for the additional features, e.g., not FeatureX but rather PageRank.
  * Features:
	  * *TODO Add each of the 6 document-query features specified in Part 1 of the assignment that was also implemented in your code.*
	      * *For example:* BM25 on 'title' field
      * *TODO Add each additional feature implemented*: *TODO implementation details*
  * Describe your rationale behind your choice of additional features. Why would you expect these do be helpful in identifying the most relevant documents to a query?

## Pre-computing features (max. 200 words)

  * Describe the choices made in saving/loading computed feature vectors to/from file to avoid redundant operations.
  * Describe the rationale behind making these choices.

## Learning algorithms (max. 300 words)

  * Briefly list and describe the machine learning algorithm(s) that were used to train the re-ranking model. Describe the hyperparameters of each algorithm.
  * Describe the rationale behind making these choices.

## Ranking experiments (max. 300 words, excluding table)

* Describe the process of finding the best performing subset of features out of all the features you developed. Include your reasoning behind each of the different subsets tried.
* How did your process of trying different hyperparameter values develop alongside the different feature subsets?
* If you used more than one machine learning algorithm, how did your feature subsets experiments inform which algorithms you tried?
* List the different feature subsets (at least 3 unique feature subsets) and their respective performance in the table below, in the order in which they were tried.

| Algorithm | Hyperparameters | Feature combination | NDCG@10 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |


* Turn the table row above corresponding to the best performing ranking *on Kaggle* into **boldface**.

## Discussion (max. 300 words)

  * What did you learn about re-ranking from the assignment, reflecting on the process of finding an optimal feature subset?
  * How would you approach this assignment differently if you had to start over from scratch?
