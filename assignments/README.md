## Rules

  * You can choose to work alone or in pairs.
    - If you work in pairs, you are not allowed to work with the same person on more than one main assignment. This rule is meant to foster collaborative group work, similar to what you would be facing in an organizational environment.
  * The size of assignments is calibrated for a single person, so those that prefer to work alone will not be negatively affected.
  * A sign-up form will be made available for each main assignment.
  * Deadlines are strict, no extensions, no exceptions!
  * Assignments account for **40% of the final grade**
